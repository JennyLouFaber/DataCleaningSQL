# DataCleaningSQL
This is another tutorial I did from Alex the Analyst.  This one is probably my favorite so far.
I knew from the moment I heard about data cleaning that I would be one of those people who would love doing it.
Up to this point in my Data Analytics education, I have been using Excel for data cleaning as I am very comfortable using the software.
Learning to data clean in SQL was so much fun, and I can't wait to do it again.  I loved learning the different scripts.
I used to love using and learning new Excel formulas, but I think I might like SQL even more.  I can't wait to do more.
